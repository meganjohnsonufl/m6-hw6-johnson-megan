## Stumbling Blocks ##
I really struggled towards the end of the assignment also. Primarily I have had trouble trying to get the sections to align in the center (vertical align) since making the sidebar. Somehow it broke the code and the margin coding in the CSS for the two classes (content and maincontent) isn't aligning it to the center.
